<h1 align="center">HubSpot CMS Boilerplate + Gulp + Webpack + SCSS + Babel</h1>

<p align="center">
  A still straight-forward starting point for building a great website on the HubSpot CMS—but better. 
</p>

## Purpose

Adds Gulp, SCSS, and Babel to the standard Hubspot CMS boilerplate. 

## Getting started

1. Do everything that the standard boilerplate requires
2. `npm install`
3. upate `gulpfile.js/webpack.js` with your Hubspot destination folder
4. Optional: set a new github remote `git remote set-url origin <your github page>`
5. Optional: push to github with gulp `gulp push -m "<your commit message>"` (stage, commit and push!)
6. `(ノಠ益ಠ)ノ彡┻━┻` if I missed an instruction (and let me know).
